# Azure Data

Star Light was a family run retail business. It has a customer dataset that has been created and stored in Azure. The database holds basic information such as customers, products, and orders.

Star Light is recently sold to a company that runs global business. To start with, the new owner would like to make these changes:

- To communicate with customers by emails, which is currently not supported
- To allow customers to review their products from website
- To store more information on their suppliers and have more than one suppliers for their products
- To set the retail price dynamically from weekly feed of suppliers
- To run monthly report to understand better on their customers

Furthermore, to run Star Light as a part of the new owner’s global business regime, making it adaptive promptly to the market’s fast changes. This is more urgent from a recent accident - a change was implemented on the Production instance that brought the Database down for a couple of days.

To prevent this from happing again in the future, your challenges are:

- To set up a test environment for this solution in Azure, so that change can be made and tested before affecting the production solution
- To deploy the change in a reliable and repeatable approach, so that it is easy to be replicated across the new owner’s global business
